    ent time, and more accurate coding, thanks to OOP’s 
inheritance method 
 Data is safe and secure, with less data corruption, thanks to hiding and abstraction. 
 It’s sharable (classes are reusable and can be distributed to other networks). 
3. Difference Between Procedure Oriented Programming (Pop) &Object-Oriented Programming (Oop) 
Object Oriented Programming 
Procedure Oriented Programming 
Divided Into 
Points 
In OOP, program is divided into parts 
called objects. 
In POP, program is divided into small 
parts called functions.

In OOP, Importance is given to the data 
rather than procedures or functions 
because it works as a real world. 
In POP, Importance is not given 
to data but 
Importance 
to 
functions 
as 
as sequence of actions to be done. 
OOP follows Bottom Up approach. 
POP follows Top Down approach. 
well 
Access 
Specifies 
Approach 
POP does not have any access specified. 
OOP has access specifies named Public, 
Private, Protected, etc. 
Data Moving 
In OOP, objects can move and 
communicate with each other through 
member functions. 
In POP, Data can move freely from 
function to function in the system. 
To add new data and function in POP is 
not so easy. 
OOP provides an easy way to add new 
data and function. 
Data Access 
Expansion 
In OOP, data cannot move easily from 
function to function, it can be kept public 
or private so we can control the access of 
data. 
In POP, Most function uses Global data 
for sharing that can be accessed freely 
from function to function in the system. 
POP does not have any proper way for 
hiding data so it is less secure. 
OOP provides Data Hiding so 
provides more security. 
Overloading 
Data Hiding 
In OOP, overloading is possible in the 
form of Function Overloading and 
Operator Overloading. 
In POP, Overloading is not possible. 
Example of OOP is: C++, JAVA, 
VB.NET, C#.NET. 
Example of POP is: C, VB, FORTRAN, 
and Pascal. 
4 Principles Of Object-Oriented Systems 
Examples 
The conceptual framework of object–oriented systems is based upon the object model. There are two categories 
of elements in an object-oriented system − 
Major Elements − By major, it is meant that if a model does not have any one of these elements, it ceases to be 
object oriented. The four major elements are − 
 Abstraction 
 Encapsulation 
 Modularity 
 Hierarchy
